The serious chat may contain messages about topics that could be triggering to certain members. By agreeing to join you may read messages that are distressing and alarming. Also please remember that no member of this chat is a trained councillor, psychologist or mental health expert and it is always best to reach out to an expert when experiencing issues concerning your mental health. However venting and talking about these issues is not against the rules in this chat. We also have helpline lists for the UK: d!ukhelplines and US: d!ushelplines

**You have been warned**.
